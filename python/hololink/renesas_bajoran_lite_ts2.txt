# WRITE <7-bit I2C address>, <length>, <offset>, <byte stream including offset>
#   I2C address is included because some offsets may require targeting a different address.
#   Length is the number of bytes in the stream, including the register offset. This could
#     be inferred by examining the byte stream but is included for convenience.
#   Offset is embedded in the byte stream but is listed separately for convenience.
